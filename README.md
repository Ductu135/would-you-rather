Greeting tutor,

This is my second final project of the react course. I am so grateful for your spending time on checking my project. Your any comments are so helpful to get me to be better after every projects. 

About this project, it is the application called Would you rather. It should be built following the requirements and clues from the course

However, there are something that I have change on my own project. I think it is okay because it still keep the requirements

To get started developing right away:

install all project dependencies with npm install
start the development server with npm start

Thank you.
